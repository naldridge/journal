Great Week!

I really like backend development. Database work especially fits in with some of my experience working with Microsoft Access.

I hope to use these skills from this week to work on a side-project. I really appreciated the Friday Free-Time to work on it. I couldn't get the fetch to work yet, so I will probably be reaching out to figure out how to get that to work...

My review blog is torn between 2 ideas. 
Either 
1) a blog review review blog - I rank and review how others review things. Break down their efforts into a rubrick and rack and stack based on categories like food reviews, location reviews, and product reviews..
2) a voice assistant review blog. pit alexa vs. google vs siri vs cortana. see which comes out on top...
