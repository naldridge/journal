Journal Entry for Week 1

Somewhat of a recap on my prior experience/knowledge
    - Worked on linux platforms before
    - Minor practice using php and python languages

In the middle of a move
    - Finding workspace was difficult
    - Splitting my time between packing/moving and working on assignments

Really excited to move forward!
