Journal Entry for Week 2

Still struggling with loops
    - For and While
    - I am committed to putting loops in my portion of the group project

Started OOP
    - Classes be crazy sometimes.
    - I could not figure out how to make a damage multiplier for the rpg exercise
        - Turns out I was doing it correctly... I just wasn't printing it correctly

Started Group Projects
    - Great group (Miguel, Rodrigo, Josh)
    - Rodrigo is a beast! I am definitely going to save his contact info
    - Day 1 felt like a whirlpool
        - I recommended we all just picked a lane for our idea and run for a bit
        - Once the "new project excitement" dissipated, we settled into discussions about structure, format, functionality.
        - Assigned specific tasks
    - Day 2 was much better
        - Once I found my pace, we were moving... too fast the day just flew by
        - I still struggle to visualize concepts without references
            - Luckily I had past projects to look at
        - We have a lot done. More to do, but I think we are moving with purpose.
        - Set schedule and expectations for the weekend...
        - We need to set time aside to look over each others' work to see what is hiding from our own faces.
