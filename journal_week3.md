This week was tough. I have a little experience with HTML and CSS, so I knew I was going to struggle.
    - I'm a copy/paste guy. Fully understanding the process that I'm going for is pretty rough.

I was excited to see the group projects for the class ahead of us. It was nice to get a glimpse of the caliber of work we may be completing in just a few short weeks.

Brittany was a great help sharing a resource to help better understand CSS... I love podcasts.
