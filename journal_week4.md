Exercises were really tough this week. My weekend will be spent working on tasks that were especially rough.

The week slowly improved for me, by the end I was following along and even completing exercises in the allotted time.

Big thanks to Brittany. She shared some resources and walked me through some of her fixes to problems we shared. It also helped that we could commiserate on some of the lessons.

This weekend I'm going back to css to work on my story and apply some of the javascript lessons.

I'm already thinking about the front-end project and I have an idea that I've sat on for a couple of years, but I don't know if I should save it for myself to work on. I guess I'll wait to see what my group thinks of it.
