I really like working with sql! I found some of my classmates struggled with statements and had reservations about using the data in their work, but I really liked working with sql and seeing data move, update, and display really helped build my confidence in my work. Nothing makes you feel better than the first time you connect to a sql database and can insert fields into a table accurately on the first try!

I'm really excited at the prospect of working with a surfing related app. In my younger days, I would have been absorbed with the potential surfing companion to help alert weather conditions, beach conditions, find beach population density, etc. to improve my surfing experience. However, I must admit when I think of an app I'd like to work on these days, it would be more focused on conservation. If anyone has been following me, they would know that animal and environmental conservation and advocacy are driving passions in my life. Working to advance the improvement of our natural world is the epitome of success in my opinion. So I'm going to be thinking about how I would like to tackle this subject and hopefully put together something that is not only going to show off my newfound skills, but also the fire I have for these subjects. I really hope when this bootcamp is over that I will be able to work somewhere my values are shared and my contributions directly impact these important issues.
